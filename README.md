# Libereus
Libereus is a Discord bot written in Python 3.6 as a submission to participate in the Moderation category of [Discord Hack Week 2019](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-build-and-create-alongside-us-6b2a7b7bba33).

##### Update:
The judgement phase is over,  and we got **second place**! Full results can be see [here](https://blog.discordapp.com/discord-community-hack-week-category-winners-bd0364360f92).
A big thank you to everyone who supported the bot and we look forward in making Libereus better as time goes on! ü§ó

It has the ability to:
> ‚úÖ Prune inactive members via their last message's date  
> ‚úÖ Disable or re-enable messaging permissions on a given channel for normal members (channel lockdown)  
> ‚úÖ Detects bad word and give strike to the sender  
> ‚úÖ Remove a prefix from members' nicknames (i.e. usage of `!` to hoist to the top of the member list)  
> ‚úÖ üí£ GENERATE A COOL SPOILER-MINESWEEPER GAME üí£  
> ...and much more!

1. Click on "Bot" at the left navigation panel, and then "Add Bot".

1. Now click on "OAuth2" on the left navigation panel, scroll down to "Scopes" and then tick on "bot".
1. Scroll further down to find "Bot Permissions" and check on "Administrator".

### Windows
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed (We recommend python 3.6). (Download it via [python.org](https://python.org))
1. Download and extract or clone this repository into your computer.
1. Create a copy of "settings_example.json" and rename it into "settings.json"
1. Open the file through your favourite text editor (Notepad may work too).
1. These are the settings for you to tweak. Scroll to the bottom and replace "your bot token here" with the bot token you just obtained from the previous step.
1. Save it. (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> for most cases)
1. Now open up the Command Prompt by pressing <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>, type in `cmd`, and then press the "OK" button.
1. In the black Command Prompt window, type in the following command. (Make sure you use `cd <your bot folder directory>` to navigate to your folder beforehand).  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. To run the bot, double click "bot.py" or do the following command in the bot's directory.
`py -3 bot.py`

### üçè Mac
> Unfortunately, this bot requires Python 3 but Mac OS X / macOS ships with Python 2.7 out of the box, thus you need to install Python 3 seperately to run this bot.
1. Open the "Terminal" application.
1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) via the following command.  
`/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
1. Install Python 3 by entering the command.  
`brew install python3`
1. Clone this repository's master branch.  
`git clone https://github.com/Tansc161/Libereus.git --branch master`
1. Make a copy of settings.json from the example given.  
`cp settings_example.json settings.json`
1. Use your favourite text editor to edit settings.json or use nano in the Terminal.  
`nano settings.json`
1. Replace "your bot token here" with the bot token that you obtained from Step 5 in "Registering an access token for your bot" above. (Please note that you need to enclose your bot token with "quotation marks".)
1. Save the file. (For nano users, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>, and then hit <kbd>Y</kbd>, and then hit <kbd>Enter</kbd>.)
1. Now run this command to install the Python libraries required for the bot.  
`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
1. Run the bot with the following command.  
`python3 bot.py`
